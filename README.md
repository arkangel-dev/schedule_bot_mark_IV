# schedule_bot_mark_IV

There are two bots users in this project. One will be used to notify the users. and the other will be used the maintainers
to update and push messages from Villa College Student desk. The second bot will also be used to cancel and reschedule sessions.

To make short term modifications to the sesssions you'd have to update the appended_session_list.json file. To make long term changes
the session_list.json file'd be modifed. The appended_session_list.json file will be reset at the end of every week.
